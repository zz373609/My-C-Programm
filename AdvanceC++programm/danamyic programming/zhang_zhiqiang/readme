Dynamic problem:
	To compile programm: g++ Dynamic.cc, g++ proj1.cc
	To run the programm: a.out file.txt
	
There are two different way to write, one I used the infinity. One Dynamic.cc I did not used the infinity. However, the one
I did not use infinity with special case when i or j == 0 has different path in input2.txt. Others are same.In addition,
the proj1.cc is exactly right.
